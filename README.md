StrongHold is a console-based medieval kingdom management simulation game written in C++. Designed to provide an engaging and strategic decision-making experience, it immerses players in the role of a ruler tasked with developing and managing their own stronghold. The game is structured around the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), utilizing encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling to deliver a modular and extensible gameplay experience. It is compatible with standard C++ compilers such as g++ and MSVC and can be executed in any C++-friendly IDE, including Code::Blocks and Visual Studio.

The project is divided into two integrated modules. Module 1: Core Kingdom Engine focuses on the internal systems of the kingdom. It includes a variety of interconnected classes that simulate population management, economic control, army recruitment, and resource allocation. The Person and SocialClass classes handle individual attributes and societal roles, while the Population class manages demographic changes and happiness. The Army class oversees training and morale, and the Economy and Bank classes control taxation, treasury, inflation, and audits. The ResourceManager class manages critical resources like food, wood, stone, and iron. To add dynamic unpredictability, the EventManager can trigger events such as famine, disease, or betrayal. Leadership styles are represented by an abstract Leader class, with specific implementations like King and Tyrant influencing gameplay differently.

In Module 2: Multiplayer and Diplomacy Engine, the game expands beyond internal kingdom systems to include player-to-player interaction. This module introduces several new systems to simulate diplomacy, communication, trade, and conflict between kingdoms. A text-based communication system allows players to send messages to each other, fostering negotiations, threats, or deception. The alliance system enables players to form, track, and break formal treaties, with consequences for betrayal. A dynamic marketplace facilitates legal trade and illegal smuggling of resources, incorporating elements such as secure routes and embargoes. The conflict system supports declarations of war, surprise attacks, and betrayal, affecting morale, resources, and territorial control. Additionally, a simple text-based grid map represents kingdom locations and zones of control, enabling strategic movement and territory management.

One of StrongHold’s key features is its robust file handling system, allowing players to save and load game states. Each subsystem—Population, Army, Economy, ResourceManager, and now Diplomacy—includes dedicated save and load functionality. This ensures that players can preserve their progress and continue their strategic campaigns at any time. Chat logs, treaty records, trade logs, and map states are all stored externally for persistence.

StrongHold is a demonstration of modular, scalable game development in C++, combining simulation and strategy with real-time decision-making and diplomacy. With both modules fully integrated, the game showcases not only strong technical implementation using OOP concepts but also offers a foundation for future expansion, such as adding network-based multiplayer, combat animations, AI-controlled kingdoms, or a graphical user interface.
